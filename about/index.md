# Rafał Adam Szałański

Hi. My name is Rafał, but people usually call me Raf or Rafa. I am a software engineer based in London, UK. There are quite a few things I find interesting, but recently I am focused on Clojure and making DevOps (as a set of practices) work. I also have got extensive experience in building, running and maintaining Ruby & Rails applications.

Oh, I think I forgot to mention that I adore skiing in every form and I'm interested in ski design.

You can see a sample code of my on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/szalansky).

I'm interested in freelance software consulting so drop me a message to <mailto:rafal.szalanski@gmail.com> if you think I could help you.
